# LLM Unlearning Research

This repository focuses on implementing and experimenting with machine unlearning techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to develop methods for selectively removing specific information or capabilities from trained models while maintaining their performance on unrelated tasks.

Key objectives:
- Implement various unlearning approaches
- Evaluate effectiveness of different methods
- Measure impact on model performance
- Develop metrics for verifying successful unlearning
